Basically, downloads all of http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/
and makes it usable.

usage:

php download.php   (or ./download.php)

This script downloads the files listed in urls.php and caches them in /cache

It creates a series of mysql dump files that you can import however you like.

You can import them by running the following: (assuming no root password)

./download.php
echo 'create database ontario_salaries;' | mysql -uroot
cat output_sql/*.sql | mysql -uroot ontario_salaries
